     <h1>dagdusheth history </h1><hr>
        <p>Dagadusheth Halwai was a successful sweet seller (Halwai) and a rich businessman &#128507;in the city of <b>Pune </b>in the late <strong>1800s.</strong> His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune.In the late 1800s, he and his wife<i> Laxmibai </i> lost their only son in a plague epidemic. The grieving couple followed the advice of a sage to build a Ganesh temple in Pune in his memory.[5] Later, Dagdusheth adopted, his <mark> nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) </mark> who was 9 years old at the time of his death. Govindsheth replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk.<hr> A generous man, he established an additional Ganesh idol in a wrestling gym called <em>Jagoba Dada Talim.</em> This talim was owned by Dagdusheth as he was also a former wrestling trainer. One of the chowk (square) in Pune is named Govind Halwai Chowk, after him. Along with his mother, Govindsheth handled all the</h1> programmes like Ganesh Utsav, Datta Jayanti and other festivities. The residence where they resided is now known as<u> Laxmibai Dagdusheth Halwai Sansthan Datta Mandir Trust. </u>Laxmi Road in Pune is named after Laxmibai Dagdusheth halwai.[citation needed] Govindsheth died in 1943</p>
